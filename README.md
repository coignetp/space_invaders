# space_invaders
A little space invaders game made with SFML.

The goal is to get more experience with C++, SFML and CMake.

# Build

* Have SFML > 2.5 installed.
* `git clone` the project.
* `mkdir build && cd build` for the build directory
* `cmake ..`
* `cmake --build .`

The SFML link may have some issues depending on how it is installed.
